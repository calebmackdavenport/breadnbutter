				<h2 id="rotd-title">Nashville Hot Chicken</h2>
				<p>Nashville's signature fried chicken dish has thick, crispy skin that's dunked in chile oil for a fiery finish, and Top
					 Chef favorite Carla Hall's version is no different.
					 Little more is needed to round it all out other than a slice of soft, white bread and a couple of pickles.
					 <br><br>
					No doubt about it, six tablespoons of cayenne is a lot, but that's what Hattie B's considers "medium." For a milder heat, decrease to two tablespoons.
